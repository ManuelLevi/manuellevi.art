# About Manuel Levi

I'm Manuel Levi, an artist whose journey has taken me from Coimbra to Singapore, London, and now Lisbon. My artistic expression is as diverse as my travels.

I invite your to explore my portfolio, where you'll find a blend of code-generated art and photos I've taken on my travels. If you share my passions for the intersection of technology and creativy, connect with me to explore the limitless possibilities of digital art.

# Artistic Journey:
My artistic journey is rooted in the influence of my family. My father is a painter, while my brother and sister are both talented musicians. Their creativity has always been an inspiration to me. 

# Artistic Style and Philosophy
My work is a fusion of technology and art. Most of my creations are born from lines of code, and I'm passionate about exploring the connections between code, data, and aesthetics. I believe that in the digital age, beauty can be found in algorithms as well as in traditional artistic forms.

# Achievements and Recognition
I'm proud to have one art piece selected to be part of an NFT collection, a testament to the evolving landscape of art in the digital world.

# Artistic Goals
My long-term goal is to help machines understand my concept of beauty. I aspire to create a machine capable of generating images using algorithms of varying complexity, ultimately allowing me to communicate and express my perceptions of art.

# Motivation and Creative Inspiration
What drives my creative process? It's a question without a simple answer. The beauty of art, in all its forms, is a continuous source of inspiration. I'm motivated by the ever-expanding possibilities of technology and the challenge of pushing the boundaries of what art can be. My work is a reflection of the interconnectedness of data, code, and aesthetics in the digital era.
